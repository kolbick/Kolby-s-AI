        <h1>The Story Behind Kolby’s AI</h1>
        <p>What began as a scrappy demo is now a connected cockpit. Kolby spent months coding late nights, wiring clinical workflows, and shipping proposals to clients. The backend is live, and the frontend finally tells the story.</p>

      <h2>Why it started</h2>
      <p>Kolby wanted an assistant that spoke the language of therapists: fast SOAP notes, discharge summaries, and treatment plans that don’t feel like chores. The first prototype was a bare-bones static site. It worked for demos but never reflected the polish or ambition behind the project.</p>

      <h2>Now a real, connected frontend</h2>
      <div class="story-grid">
        <div>
          <h3>Backend is online</h3>
          <p>The UI calls the configured OpenWebUI endpoint with the JWT stored in the repo’s configuration. Every chat you see in the cockpit is powered by that live backend.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Designed for clinicians</h3>
          <p>Navigation highlights clinical actions—new chat, models, notes, plans, and discharge summaries—so workflows feel cohesive instead of patched together.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Mobile matters</h3>
          <p>The refreshed layout keeps the chat input usable above the keyboard, adds a reliable hamburger menu, and keeps buttons comfortably tappable down to 320px.</p>

    <section class="story-section">
      <h2>The vision</h2>
      <p>Kolby’s AI is built to slot into therapist workflows: capture a note, summarize progress, and hand off a treatment plan without breaking focus. The pirate logo stays playful, but the mission is serious—help clinicians reclaim their time while keeping clinical quality front and center.</p>
